# FedMed

## Privacy-Preserving Cross-Silo Federated Learning Engine for Medical AI

FedMed is a modular federated learning engine designed for privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning across distributed medical institutions.

The system separates the framework-independent federated learning core from the Flower runtime layer, allowing the core training, strategy, aggregation, data, and model components to remain independent of the federated-learning framework.

---

# 1. Project Overview

FedMed is designed around a cross-silo federated learning architecture where multiple medical organizations can collaboratively train a machine learning model without directly sharing their local training data.

The current implementation focuses on:

- Federated client-server training
- Federated rounds
- Model parameter exchange
- FedAvg aggregation
- Client selection
- Client failure handling
- IID and label-skew data partitioning
- Local training configuration
- Data quantity imbalance
- Centralized vs federated experimentation
- Flower 1.34.0 runtime integration
- Deterministic and reproducible experiments
- Automated testing

The project is currently being developed as a modular research and experimentation platform.

---

# 2. Architecture

FedMed follows a framework-independent core architecture with Flower isolated at the application boundary.

3. Core Design Principles

3.1 Framework Independence

The main federated learning logic remains under:

src/

The core does not depend on Flower transport or Flower message structures.

Flower-specific behavior remains under:

app/

This keeps the federated learning engine separated from the runtime framework.


---

3.2 Strategy and Aggregator Separation

FedMed intentionally separates federation policy from mathematical aggregation.

FedMed Strategy
       |
       | federation policy
       | client selection
       | round decisions
       v
Aggregator
       |
       | mathematical aggregation
       v
Aggregated Parameters

The responsibility split is:

Strategy
    ├── client selection
    ├── federation policy
    ├── round-level decisions
    └── delegates aggregation

Aggregator
    └── mathematical parameter aggregation

The current implementation uses:

FedAvgStrategy
        |
        v
FedAvgAggregator

The Flower adapter does not duplicate FedAvg mathematics.


---

4. Flower Runtime Architecture

FedMed currently integrates with:

Flower 1.34.0

The Flower runtime boundary is:

Flower ServerApp
       |
       v
FedMedFlowerStrategy
       |
       v
FedMed FedAvgStrategy
       |
       v
FedAvgAggregator

The Flower adapter is implemented in:

app/server.py

The client adapter is implemented in:

app/client.py

The application composition root is:

app/main.py

The framework-independent composition root is:

src/fl/orchestrator.py


---

5. Flower Server Adapter

app/server.py contains the Flower-side server adapter.

The main class is:

FedMedFlowerStrategy

Its responsibilities include:

Flower node selection

Training message construction

Evaluation message construction

Flower Message handling

Training-result conversion

Evaluation-result conversion

Delegation to the FedMed strategy

Handling failed client replies

Aggregating successful client results

Returning Flower-compatible responses


The Flower adapter does not implement FedAvg mathematics directly.


---

6. Training Flow

The federated training flow is:

Flower ServerApp
       |
       v
configure_train()
       |
       +--> Select Flower nodes
       |
       +--> Read global parameters
       |
       +--> Create training configuration
       |
       +--> Add server round
       |
       +--> Construct Flower Messages
       |
       v
Flower SuperNode
       |
       v
Flower ClientApp
       |
       v
FedMed FederatedClient
       |
       v
Local Training
       |
       v
Training Result
       |
       v
Flower Server
       |
       v
aggregate_train()
       |
       v
FedMed Strategy
       |
       v
FedAvgAggregator
       |
       v
New Global Parameters


---

7. Evaluation Flow

The evaluation flow is:

Flower ServerApp
       |
       v
configure_evaluate()
       |
       +--> Select evaluation nodes
       |
       +--> Create evaluation configuration
       |
       +--> Construct EVALUATE messages
       |
       v
Flower ClientApp
       |
       v
Local Evaluation
       |
       v
Evaluation Result
       |
       v
Flower Server
       |
       v
aggregate_evaluate()
       |
       v
FedMed Strategy
       |
       v
Aggregated Evaluation Metrics


---

8. Flower Compatibility

FedMed was verified against:

Flower 1.34.0

The Flower runtime uses:

arrays
config

as the standard record keys.

Training messages therefore contain:

arrays
config

Evaluation messages use the same record structure.

The Flower adapter converts Flower results into FedMed result objects.

For training:

Flower FitRes
      |
      v
FederatedFitResult

For evaluation:

Flower EvaluateRes
      |
      v
FederatedEvaluateResult

The conversion layer validates:

parameter payloads

number of examples

metric types

numeric metric values

result status


Parameter arrays are copied at the Flower/FedMed boundary to avoid accidental mutation between the two layers.


---

9. FedMed Orchestrator

The composition root is:

src/fl/orchestrator.py

FedMedOrchestrator assembles:

models

training configuration

evaluation

data partitions

federated clients

strategies

aggregators

Flower ClientApp

Flower ServerApp


The orchestrator provides:

build_client()
build_strategy()
build_client_app()
build_server_app()
build_apps()

The orchestrator now uses the FedMed data-loader abstraction:

src.data.loader.create_dataloader

instead of constructing a raw PyTorch DataLoader directly.


---

10. Data Partitioning

FedMed supports:

IID
Label Skew

The partitioning logic is implemented in:

src/data/partitioner.py

The partitioner provides deterministic client partitions using configured seeds.

Example:

Global Dataset
      |
      v
Partitioner
      |
      +---- Client 0
      |
      +---- Client 1
      |
      +---- Client 2
      |
      +---- Client 3

The project includes tests covering the partitioning behavior.


---

11. Client Training

Each federated client contains:

Model
Trainer
Evaluator
Training Data
Evaluation Data
Client ID

The client performs:

Receive Global Parameters
          |
          v
Load Parameters
          |
          v
Local Training
          |
          v
Return Updated Parameters
          |
          v
Local Evaluation

The current training implementation uses PyTorch.

The smoke-test model is:

FlowerSmokeTestModel


---

12. Client Failure Handling

FedMed includes controlled client-failure experimentation.

The Flower client runtime supports an E6 controlled dropout mechanism through:

app/failure_mod.py

The purpose is to test whether a failed training client prevents the remaining clients from completing a federated round.

The server handles failed training replies by ignoring the failed client and continuing aggregation using successful clients.


---

13. Experimental Methodology

Each experiment follows a controlled workflow:

1. Define objective
       |
2. Fix unrelated configuration
       |
3. Change one experimental variable
       |
4. Run federated workload
       |
5. Record metrics
       |
6. Record parameter fingerprints
       |
7. Record runtime evidence
       |
8. Document observations

Experiments are treated as observations of the current configuration rather than universal conclusions.


---

14. Federated Learning Experiments

The current completed experiments are:

E1 — Baseline Reproducibility
E2 — Client Count
E3 — Training Client Participation Fraction
E4 — Number of Federated Rounds
E5 — IID vs Non-IID Data
E6 — Client Failure / Dropout
E7 — Local Epochs
E8 — Data Quantity Imbalance
E9 — Centralized vs Federated Training


---

15. E1 — Baseline Reproducibility

Objective

Verify that the same FedMed configuration produces reproducible federated-learning results across repeated executions.

Configuration:

Clients: 2
Rounds: 3
Train fraction: 1.0
Evaluation fraction: 1.0
Local epochs: 1
Partition: IID
Strategy: FedAvgStrategy
Aggregator: FedAvgAggregator

The experiment was executed twice using the same configuration.

Parameter fingerprints:

Round 1:
5d2399307f878547
        ->
166dbbaac8c674b6

Round 2:
166dbbaac8c674b6
        ->
2c9f2041b7a13ade

Round 3:
2c9f2041b7a13ade
        ->
32346c94ed9fdb6f

Results:

Train loss:
R1 0.8096474260
R2 0.8063939661
R3 0.8031985164

Evaluation loss:
R1 0.6489310861
R2 0.6493559479
R3 0.6498010904

Accuracy:
50.00% every round

Examples:
16 per round

The repeated runs produced matching parameter fingerprints and metrics, validating deterministic behavior for this baseline configuration.


---

16. E2 — Client Count

Objective

Observe federated-learning behavior as the number of participating Flower clients changes.

All experiments used:

Rounds: 3
Training fraction: 100%
Evaluation fraction: 100%

E2-A — 1 Client

Training clients: 1
Evaluation clients: 1
Examples per round: 8

Train loss:
0.8189847767
0.8152351081
0.8115414977

Evaluation loss:
0.6616895199
0.6618472934
0.6620339751

Accuracy:
50.00%

E2-B — 2 Clients

Training clients: 2
Evaluation clients: 2
Examples per round: 16

Train loss:
0.8096474260
0.8063939661
0.8031985164

Evaluation loss:
0.6489310861
0.6493559479
0.6498010904

Accuracy:
50.00%

E2-C — 3 Clients

Training clients: 3
Evaluation clients: 3
Examples per round: 24

Train loss:
0.7625652552
0.7611813347
0.7598178188

Evaluation loss:
0.6903412938
0.6900853515
0.6898385584

Accuracy:
41.67%

The experiment changes both client count and total participating data because each client contributes 8 examples. Therefore, the experiment does not isolate client count as a completely independent variable.


---

17. E3 — Training Client Participation Fraction

Objective

Validate client participation fraction handling in the real Flower multi-node runtime.

Configuration:

Available clients: 4
Rounds: 3
Evaluation fraction: 1.0
Local epochs: 1

Results

Training Fraction	Training Clients	Evaluation Clients

100%	4	4
75%	3	4
50%	2	4
25%	1	4


The Flower runtime correctly selected:

100% -> 4 clients
75%  -> 3 clients
50%  -> 2 clients
25%  -> 1 client

Observed accuracies:

100%:
43.75%, 43.75%, 43.75%

75%:
43.75%, 43.75%, 43.75%

50%:
56.25%, 56.25%, 59.375%

25%:
56.25%, 59.375%, 59.375%

These results describe the particular deterministic client-selection configuration and should not be interpreted as evidence that lower participation is inherently better.


---

18. E4 — Number of Federated Rounds

Objective

Examine the behavior of the system across an increased number of federated rounds.

Configuration:

Clients: 4
Rounds: 5
Training participation: 100%
Evaluation participation: 100%

Results:

Round 1:
Train loss = 0.6799688861
Eval loss  = 0.7347568944
Accuracy   = 0.46875

Round 2:
Train loss = 0.6799019128
Eval loss  = 0.7345721349

Round 3:
Train loss = 0.6798361465
Eval loss  = 0.7343898416

Round 4:
Train loss = 0.6797715276
Eval loss  = 0.7342100814

Round 5:
Train loss = 0.6797080487
Eval loss  = 0.7340327278

Accuracy remained:

46.875%

for all five rounds.

The experiment confirms successful execution across five federated rounds.


---

19. E5 — IID vs Label-Skew Data

Objective

Compare the federated workflow under IID and label-skew data partitioning.

Configuration:

Clients: 4
Rounds: 3
Training participation: 100%
Evaluation participation: 100%

E5-A — IID

Train loss:
0.6870625988
0.6868757978
0.6866935045

Eval loss:
0.6867602393
0.6865770072
0.6863982305

Accuracy:
50.00%

E5-B — Label Skew

Train loss:
0.6842055842
0.6840200424
0.6838389635

Eval loss:
0.6867608801
0.6865782812
0.6864000931

Accuracy:
50.00%

Both partitioning configurations completed successfully in the real Flower runtime.

The experiment confirms that the FedMed partitioning and aggregation pipeline can execute with both IID and label-skew client distributions.


---

20. E6 — Client Failure / Dropout

Objective

Test federated-round resilience when one training client fails.

Configuration:

Flower SuperNodes: 4
Partitions: 0, 1, 2, 3
Training participation: 100%
Evaluation participation: 100%
Rounds: 3
Data partitioning: IID
Controlled failure: Partition 0 during Round 2
Failure scope: TRAIN only

Results:

Round	Successful Training Clients	Training Examples	Train Loss	Eval Loss	Accuracy

1	4/4	32	0.687063	0.686760	0.5000
2	3/4	24	0.701005	0.686616	0.5000
3	4/4	32	0.686734	0.686436	0.5000


During Round 2, the controlled client failure was triggered:

E6 controlled client dropout: partition=0, round=2

The server ignored the failed training reply and continued aggregation using the successful clients.

Round 2 therefore completed with:

3 successful training clients
24 training examples

Round 3 returned to:

4 successful training clients
32 training examples

This demonstrates the implemented client-failure tolerance path in the Flower runtime.


---

21. E7 — Local Epochs

Objective

Study the effect of different local training epoch configurations while keeping the federated runtime configuration fixed.

Configurations:

E7-A -> 1 local epoch
E7-B -> 2 local epochs
E7-C -> 5 local epochs

Fixed configuration:

Flower SuperNodes: 4
Training participation: 100%
Evaluation participation: 100%
Rounds: 3
Partitioning: IID
Batch size: 4
Learning rate: 0.01
Optimizer: SGD
Seed: 42
Controlled failure: disabled

E7 Summary

Metric	1 Epoch	2 Epochs	5 Epochs

Final train loss	0.686694	0.682896	0.672117
Final eval loss	0.686398	0.685882	0.684518
Accuracy	0.5000	0.5000	0.5000
Train examples/round	32	64	160
Batches/client	2	4	10
Runtime	250.32s	250.24s	311.00s


All three configurations completed all three federated rounds.

The experiments showed lower training loss with increasing local epochs in this configuration, while measured accuracy remained 0.5000.


---

22. E8 — Data Quantity Imbalance

Objective

Evaluate federated training with unequal quantities of local training data while using balanced evaluation data.

Configuration:

Clients: 4
Rounds: 3
Training participation: 100%
Evaluation participation: 100%
Partitioning: IID
Local epochs: 5
Batch size: 4
Learning rate: 0.01
Optimizer: SGD
Seed: 42

Training distribution:

Client 0 -> 4 examples
Client 1 -> 8 examples
Client 2 -> 8 examples
Client 3 -> 12 examples

Total -> 32 examples

Evaluation distribution:

Client 0 -> 8 examples
Client 1 -> 8 examples
Client 2 -> 8 examples
Client 3 -> 8 examples

Total -> 32 examples

Results:

Round	Train Loss	Eval Loss	Accuracy	Eval Examples

1	0.680932	0.686110	0.5000	32
2	0.680199	0.685398	0.5000	32
3	0.679574	0.684794	0.5000	32


The experiment exercises the example-weighted aggregation path using heterogeneous local training-data quantities.


---

23. E9 — Centralized vs Federated Training

Objective

Compare centralized training with the existing federated workflow under matched training-data exposure.

Common configuration:

Training samples: 32
Batch size: 4
Learning rate: 0.01
Optimizer: SGD
Seed: 42

Both configurations process:

480 example-passes


---

E9-A — Centralized Training

Samples: 32
Epochs: 15
Batch size: 4
Example-passes: 480

Results:

Metric	Result

Epochs	15
Samples processed	480
Batches processed	120
Final train loss	0.6817503422
Evaluation samples	32
Evaluation loss	0.6809001043
Accuracy	0.5000
Runtime	16.54s


The centralized experiment was implemented using the existing:

Trainer
Evaluator
FlowerSmokeTestModel
FedMedDataset


---

E9-B — Federated Training

The federated baseline reuses the previously validated E7-C experiment.

Configuration:

Clients: 4
Training examples/client: 8
Rounds: 3
Local epochs: 5
Training example-passes: 480

Results:

Metric	Result

Federated rounds	3
Local epochs	5
Training examples/round	32
Final train loss	0.672117
Final evaluation loss	0.684518
Accuracy	0.5000
Runtime	311.00s


The federated runtime includes Flower orchestration and distributed-runtime overhead.

These results are specific to this experimental configuration and are not treated as general conclusions about centralized or federated learning.


---

25. Upgrade and Refactoring Work

After completing the experimental phase, FedMed entered a module-upgrade phase.

The upgrade workflow is:

Inspect
   |
Understand
   |
Identify actual problem
   |
Design upgrade
   |
Implement
   |
Unit Tests
   |
Integration Tests
   |
Full Regression
   |
Commit

The first upgrade work focused on:

src/fl/orchestrator.py


---

26. Orchestrator Upgrade

The orchestrator was reviewed for unnecessary framework-specific data-loader construction.

Previously the orchestrator directly constructed:

torch.utils.data.DataLoader

The implementation was updated to use the existing FedMed abstraction:

src.data.loader.create_dataloader

This keeps data-loader construction behind the FedMed data layer.

The unused TensorDataset import was also removed.

The change was committed as:

0413414
refactor: use FedMed dataloader abstraction


---

27. Evaluation Split Correction

During the orchestrator review, an existing E8 integration mismatch was identified.

The partition loader already supported:

split="train"
split="eval"

but build_client() was previously constructing both loaders using the training split.

The implementation was corrected so that:

train_loader = self._create_partitioned_loader(
    partition_index
)

eval_loader = self._create_partitioned_loader(
    partition_index,
    split="eval",
)

Therefore the client now receives separate training and evaluation partitions.

A regression test was added to verify:

client_0 training samples = 4
client_0 evaluation samples = 8

The fix was committed as:

4804da3
fix: use evaluation split for client evaluation


---

28. Test Coverage

FedMed currently has a large automated test suite covering:

Configuration

38. Current Development Direction

FedMed has completed its initial federated-learning runtime and experimentation stage.

The project is now moving into the module upgrade and productionization stage.

The upgrade process will continue module-by-module:

Inspect
   ↓
Understand
   ↓
Identify actual issue
   ↓
Design focused improvement
   ↓
Implement
   ↓
Add/update tests
   ↓
Integration verification
   ↓
Full regression
   ↓
Commit

The goal is to improve the existing implementation without unnecessarily changing the established FedMed architecture.

About

FedMed is a privacy-preserving cross-silo federated learning engine for collaborative medical AI.

The project focuses on building a modular, testable and experimentally validated federated learning runtime that can support future medical machine-learning workloads without requiring centralized sharing of local training data.

### One thing I recommend before pasting

Your current GitHub README is **much more outdated than the actual repository**. The version above updates the important stale parts:

- `609 passed` instead of `577`
- E1–E9 included
- E6/E7/E8/E9 results included
- current orchestrator refactoring included
- evaluation-split correction included
- current Flower topology with **4 SuperNodes**
- `FedMedFlowerStrategy` described as the Flower adapter
- Strategy/Aggregator separation preserved
- current development status changed from runtime-completion to **module upgrade phase**
- latest commits `0413414` and `4804da3` included
